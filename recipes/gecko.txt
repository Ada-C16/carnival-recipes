2. Pour milk over the bread slices. Allow it to soak in for several minutes.
5. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a broiler pan, which will allow the fat to drain.
7. Lay bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf.
8. Make the sauce: add ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl. Stir together.
